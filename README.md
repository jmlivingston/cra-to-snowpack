# Add Snowpack to an existing create-react-app

The goal of this repo is to provide a way to easily add [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/) to an existing project generated by [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) without breaking any existing functionality and still allow debugging or building with `create-react-app`. A secondary goal was to deploy to GitHub pages.

> Disclaimer: This has only been tested with a minimally generated `create-react-app`, so may not work with one that has been ejected or heavily modified.

> TLDR: If you'd prefer to skip these steps, I've created a gist you can copy or run with npx within an existing create-react-app:

## Steps

### 1. Dependencies

In order to add `Snowpack` support to an existing `create-react-app`, and mimic dev and build capabilities, use the following steps.

- Install dev depdencies: `cross-env`, `snowpack`, and `@snowpack/plugin-react-refresh` (@snowpack/plugin-react-refresh is optional).

```bash
npm i cross-env snowpack @snowpack/plugin-react-refresh -D
```

> Note: `cross-env` is used to pass a variable and used in the `index.html` file to conditionally import Snowpack's entry point. While a `.env` file could be used, this won't work if Snowpack is consuming the same `.env`. Using `cross-env` ensures it is isolated only to `create-react-app` npm scripts.

### 2. npm scripts

- Update the package.json npm scripts to pass a `REACT_APP_MODE` environmental variable to the start and build scripts. Also add `Snowpack` scripts for start and build. I've included a `build-serve` script, but this is purely optional for testing your builds locally.

```json
"start": "cross-env REACT_APP_MODE=true react-scripts start",
"build": "cross-env REACT_APP_MODE=true react-scripts build",
"start-snowpack": "snowpack dev",
"build-snowpack": "snowpack build",
"build-serve": "npx http-server build -o",
```

### 3. Snowpack configuration

- Add a `snowpack.config.js` file to the root directory with the following. Alternatively, as in this repo, add a `snowpack` property with the same content to package.json for less clutter in the root directory. The `npx` script adds this to package.json, but it can be easily moved.

```js
module.exports = {
  baseOptions: {
    baseUrl: './',
  },
  exclude: ['**/setupTests.js'],
  mount: {
    public: { url: '/', static: true },
    src: { url: '/dist' },
  },
  plugins: ['@snowpack/plugin-react-refresh'],
}
```

### 4. Change .js files to .jsx

- Change all components using `.js` extension to `.jsx`. (Note: This is fully supported by `create-react-app`.)

### 5. Ensure React is being imported

- Ensure that all `.jsx` files include an import reference to React. In newer version of `create-react-app`, this is not needed, but it is required by `Snowpack`.

`import React from 'react'`

- Update `public/index.html` by prefixing all references of `%PUBLIC_URL%` with a ".". This was primarily done to handle GitHub pages, but may not be needed if you're deploying differently. Also, if you are doing custom build steps with create-react-app using `PUBLIC_URL` or using it in other ways, this may not work.

### 6. Tweak public url links

```html
<link rel="icon" href=".%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" />
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href=".%PUBLIC_URL%/logo192.png" />
<link rel="manifest" href=".%PUBLIC_URL%/manifest.json" />
```

- Update the `public/index.html` to include the following before the `</body>` closing tag. As mentioned above, this condition will only be true when `Snowpack` is being run.

### 7. Add

```html
<script type="module">
  if ('%REACT_APP_MODE%' !== 'true') import('/dist/index.js')
</script>
```

---

> Bonus - If you are deploying to GitHub pages or other static hosting providers, you may notice that the paths generated for svg proxies will be incorrect. `Snowpack` is using `esbuild` for very fast builds, but that package is still a work in progress. You can opt for the `Webpack` or `Rollup` plugin or continue to let `create-react-app` handle your build. Alternatively, I have written a hack that will update the paths which you can use as a post build step in `post-build-gh-pages.js`. This is very much a hack, but should get you over the hurdle if needed.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
